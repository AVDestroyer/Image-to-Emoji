# Image-to-Emoji
Simple Python script to convert an image to a grid of Emojis

## Usage
- Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/AVDestroyer/Image-to-Emoji/
cd Image-to-Emoji
```
- Install the dependencies
```
pip install pillow
pip install opencv-python
```
- Run the script. Enter the file path to the image that you want to turn to emoji, and the resolution in pixels that each emoji covers.
- The script will output to `out.txt`. Copy paste the emoji grid from here into Discord, google docs, or another program to render the emoji correctly.
    - Make sure to not make the emoji resolution too small if you are copy pasting into Discord, or else your Discord will crash.
